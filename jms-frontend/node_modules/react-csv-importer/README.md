# React CSV Importer

[![https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-csv-importer](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-csv-importer)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-csv-importer) [![https://github.com/beamworks/react-csv-importer/actions](https://github.com/beamworks/react-csv-importer/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/beamworks/react-csv-importer/actions)

This library combines an uploader + CSV parser + raw file preview + UI for custom user column
mapping, all in one. It wraps the popular PapaParse CSV library to preview and process file contents directly in-browser.

Use this to implement the following bulk data import story in your app:

- üì§ user drag-drops (or selects) a file for upload
- üëì previews the raw uploaded data before parsing
- ‚úè picks which columns to import

Your front-end code will receive parsed CSV data as a series of JSON objects. You can then validate and send the data to the backend in any final format it may require instead of raw CSV. Parsing is async-enabled, so your logic can take its time: meanwhile, the user will see an animated progress bar.

### Feature summary:

- wraps the well-known Papa Parse CSV library
- raw file preview
- user-selectable column mapping (drag-drop UI)
- auto-map fields to matching column names
- TypeScript support
- screen reader a11y
- keyboard a11y
- i18n

### Enterprise-level data file handling:

- 1GB+ CSV file size (true streaming support without crashing browser)
- automatically strip leading BOM character in data
- fixes a [multibyte streaming issue in PapaParse](https://github.com/mholt/PapaParse/issues/908)
- runs entirely in-browser
- async parsing logic (pauses while your app makes backend updates)

The UI theme CSS is standalone (no external dependencies such as Material UI) and tailored to
universally fit within most application design frameworks. Interface elements are tested for screen
reader accessibility and keyboard-only usage (yes, actually!).

## Install

```sh
# using NPM
npm install --save react-csv-importer

# using Yarn
yarn add react-csv-importer
```

This package is easy to fork with your own customizations, and you can use your fork directly as a [Git dependency](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#git-urls-as-dependencies) in any of your projects, see below.

## Example Usage

```js
import { Importer, ImporterField } from 'react-csv-importer';

// include the widget CSS file whichever way your bundler supports it
import 'react-csv-importer/dist/index.css';

// in your component code:
<Importer
  assumeNoHeaders={false} // optional, keeps "data has headers" checkbox off by default
  restartable={false} // optional, lets user choose to upload another file when import is complete
  onStart={({ file, preview, fields, columnFields }) => {
    // optional, invoked when user has mapped columns and started import
    prepMyAppForIncomingData();
  }}
  processChunk={async (rows, { startIndex }) => {
    // required, may be called several times
    // receives a list of parsed objects based on defined fields and user column mapping;
    // (if this callback returns a promise, the widget will wait for it before parsing more data)
    for (row of rows) {
      await myAppMethod(row);
    }
  }}
  onComplete={({ file, preview, fields, columnFields }) => {
    // optional, invoked right after import is done (but user did not dismiss/reset the widget yet)
    showMyAppToastNotification();
  }}
  onClose={({ file, preview, fields, columnFields }) => {
    // optional, if this is specified the user will see a "Finish" button after import is done,
    // which will call this when clicked
    goToMyAppNextPage();
  }}

  // CSV options passed directly to PapaParse if specified:
  // delimiter={...}
  // newline={...}
  // quoteChar={...}
  // escapeChar={...}
  // comments={...}
  // skipEmptyLines={...}
  // delimitersToGuess={...}
  // chunkSize={...} // defaults to 10000
  // encoding={...} // defaults to utf-8, see FileReader API
>
  <ImporterField name="name" label="Name" />
  <ImporterField name="email" label="Email" />
  <ImporterField name="dob" label="Date of Birth" optional />
  <ImporterField name="postalCode" label="Postal Code" optional />
</Importer>;
```

In the above example, if the user uploads a CSV file with column headers "Name", "Email" and so on, the columns will be automatically matched to fields with same labels. If any of the headers do not match, the user will have an opportunity to manually remap columns to the defined fields.

The `preview` object available to some callbacks above contains a snippet of CSV file information (only the first portion of the file is read, not the entire thing). The structure is:

```js
{
  rawData: '...', // raw string contents of first file chunk
  columns: [ // array of preview columns, e.g.:
    { index: 0, header: 'Date', values: [ '2020-09-20', '2020-09-25' ] },
    { index: 1, header: 'Name', values: [ 'Alice', 'Bob' ] }
  ],
  skipHeaders: false, // true when user selected that data has no headers
  parseWarning: undefined, // any non-blocking warning object produced by Papa Parse
}
```

Importer component children may be defined as a render-prop function that receives an object with `preview` and `file` fields (see above). It can then, for example, dynamically return different fields depending which headers are present in the CSV.

## Dependencies

- [Papa Parse](https://www.papaparse.com/) for CSV parsing
- [react-dropzone](https://react-dropzone.js.org/) for file upload
- [react-use-gesture](https://github.com/react-spring/react-use-gesture) for drag-and-drop

## Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n)

You can swap the text used in the UI to a different locale.

```
import { Importer, deDE } from 'react-csv-importer';

// provide the locale to main UI
<Importer
  locale={deDE}
  // normal props, etc
/>
```

You can also pass your own fully custom locale definition as the locale value. See `ImporterLocale` interface in `src/locale` for the full definition, and use an existing locale like `enUS` as basis. For better performance, please ensure that the value is stable (i.e. does not change on every render).

## Local Development

Perform local `git clone`, etc. Then ensure modules are installed:

```sh
yarn
```

To start Storybook to have a hot-reloaded local sandbox:

```sh
yarn storybook
```

To run the end-to-end test suite:

```sh
yarn test
```

You can use your own fork of this library in your own project by referencing the forked repo as a [Git dependency](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#git-urls-as-dependencies). NPM will then run the `prepare` script, which runs the same Webpack/dist command as when the NPM package is published, so your custom dependency should work just as conveniently as the stock NPM version. Of course if your custom fixes could be useful to the rest of us then please submit a PR to this repo!
